# Features
-  **Register/Log-in:**  The user can register an account before accessing the other features of the app. Users register using a Google Account which takes their name, display name, and email address, which can be used as their account for DailyLines.
- **Journal Entry:** The user will have the option to do a daily reflection, at which point they will be directed to a blank page where they can freely journal. They also have the option to include a photo in their daily journal entry.
-  **Settings:**  This offers the user an opportunity to edit the appearance of the application (dark/light mode). Furthermore, the user can also change their display name and avatar/picture to be displayed on their profile screen. This is also where the user can sign out from their account.
- **Randomized Quotes:** The app will give the user a new quote every time the home screen is opened. 
- **Push Notification:** Every day at 11 AM, the app will notify the user to write their daily journal and select their mood of the day. Notifications from the members of the project can be scheduled via Firebase's Messaging feature
-  **Journal Archives:** The user will be able to revisit and read their past entries under the Archive section of the application.
