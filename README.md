# DailyLines - MOBDEVE S12 Final Project

The proposed mobile application is a personal journaling app. The application’s goal is to help in good health and well-being as it would promote individuals to organize thoughts and express emotions in a positive way. Users are greeted with a quick mood check-in on how their day is going. In the home screen, users can create 1 journal every day which may include write-ups and photos of their day. A quote of the day is also displayed on the home screen. Moreover, the app aims to help keep track of the user’s overall well-being by displaying all-time stats of their check-ins.


# Features
-  **Register/Log-in:**  The user can register an account before accessing the other features of the app. Users register using a Google Account which takes their name, display name, and email address.
- **Journal Entry:** After tracking their emotions, the user will have the option to do a daily reflection, at which point they will be directed to a blank page where they can freely journal. They also have the option to include photos in their daily journal entry.
-  **Settings:**  This offers the user an opportunity to edit the appearance of the application (dark/light mode) and set their daily notifications as per their preference. Furthermore, the user can also change their display name and avatar/picture to be displayed on their profile screen.
- **Mood Summary:** The user will be able to access a summary of said tracked emotions from as far back as the past month or two.
- **Randomized Quotes:** The app will give the user a new quote every time the home screen is opened. 
- **Push Notification:** Every day at 11 AM, the app will notify the user to write their daily journal and select their mood of the day. Notifications from the members of the project can be scheduled via Firebase's Messaging feature
-  **Journal Archives:** The user will be able to revisit and read their past entries under the Archive section of the application. Users are also given the opportunity to filter and view these by week, month, and year.**
